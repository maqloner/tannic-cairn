4 days ago, three village youth went camping to prove their courage during a midsummer festival. 3 days ago, they failed to return. Can you brave the haunted forest and bring them home to safety?

Tannic is a love letter to the pine barrens, youthful adventures, and campfire stories.  It's intended as a level 1-3 one shot adventure with stats provided for Cairn and Old School Essentials. It is dynamic and easily adaptable to your system of choice.
